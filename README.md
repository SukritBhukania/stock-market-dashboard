# Stock Market Dashboard

This project provides an end-to-end solution for stock market data analysis, including a data pipeline, interactive visualizations, and real-time financial insights. It allows users to fetch stock market data across multiple industries, perform analysis, and visualize the results through charts and graphs. The system also includes features for forecasting, industry-wise analysis, and calculation of key financial ratios such as P/E ratio, market capitalization, and dividend yield.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Python-based stock market data pipeline, analytics system, and dashboard. The system fetches stock data from the Yahoo Finance API, stores it in a database, performs key financial analysis (P/E ratio, market cap, dividend yield), and visualizes industry-specific performance trends. Users can view detailed reports on stock performance, download the data, and interact with visualizations using a Flask-based web interface.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for backend scripting and data processing.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to build the backend for the dashboard and serve interactive visualizations.
- **Plotly**: Used for generating interactive charts and graphs.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation library for processing the stock data.
- **yfinance**: Library used to fetch stock market data from Yahoo Finance API.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Database for storing processed stock data (can be extended for future use).
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Frontend code for the dashboard and user interface.

---

## Features

- **Stock Data Fetching**: The system fetches stock data for top companies across multiple industries (Technology, Finance, Healthcare, etc.) using the Yahoo Finance API.
- **Industry-Wise Analysis**: Provides detailed charts and graphs of stock performance within specific industries, including trends, risk (volatility), and volume traded.
- **Financial Ratios**: Calculates and displays key financial ratios such as P/E ratio, market capitalization, and dividend yield for each stock.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Uses Plotly to generate interactive and user-friendly charts and graphs for stock data analysis.
- **Forecasting**: Provides stock market forecasting and risk predictions for each industry.
- **Downloadable Data**: Users can download the latest stock data in Excel format for further analysis.
- **Search & Filter**: Interactive search and filter options allow users to find stocks by industry, company name, or stock symbol.

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with:

- **Backend**: Python-based Flask application that serves as the backend for fetching and processing stock data.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the web interface. Interactive charts and data tables are used to present the results.
- **Database**: A MySQL or PostgreSQL database is used to store and retrieve historical stock data.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-dashboard.git
   cd stock-market-dashboard
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
  ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
  ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set up the database (if applicable):**
•	Modify the database connection settings in config.py (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
•	Run the necessary migration commands to set up the database schema.

5. **Fetch Stock Data:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
## Usage
1.	Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2.	Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to view the Stock Market Dashboard.
3.	Features:
	•	Home Page: Displays stock data with an option to download the Excel file.
	•	Industry Analysis: Shows performance trends, volatility, and trading volume for specific industries.
	•	Financial Ratios & Forecast: Displays key ratios and forecasts for stock analysis.

## Scalability
•	Handling Larger Data: To handle larger datasets, consider setting up a database to store stock data and enable automatic data updates via scheduled jobs (cron jobs or Flask scheduled tasks).
•	Cloud Deployment: Deploy the application on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku) to support more users and ensure scalability.
•	Advanced Analytics: Future work can include implementing machine learning models for stock trend prediction and integrating more complex financial analysis tools.

## Running the Application
1.	Start the Application:
	•	Run the Flask application using python app.py.
2.	Visit the Application:
	•	Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
	•	Explore different pages: Home, Industry Analysis, and Ratios & Forecast.

## Future Work
•	Stock Prediction: Implement machine learning algorithms like LSTM or ARIMA for stock trend predictions.
•	Advanced Risk Analysis: Add more metrics such as Sharpe ratio, Beta, and Value at Risk (VaR) for more comprehensive risk analysis.
•	User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to save their preferred stocks and analysis settings.
•	Real-Time Data: Fetch and display real-time stock data using WebSockets or integrate with a real-time data API like Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud.
